Description: Fast and easily computes an Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) from data,
    relying on 'mlpack' - the R API for the C++ Machine Learning Library (Curtin et. al., 2013).
    The Dual-Tree Boruvka (March, Ram, Gray, 2010, <doi:10.1145/1835804.1835882>) is theoretically 
    and empirically the fastest algorithm for computing an EMST. This package also provides 
    functions and an S3 method for readily plotting Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) using either the 
    style of the 'base', 'scatterplot3d', or 'ggplot2' libraries.
