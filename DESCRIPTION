Description: Fast and easily computes an Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) from data. 
    This package relies on 'RcppMLPACK' to provide an \R interface to the Dual-Tree Boruvka 
    algorithm (March, Ram, Gray, 2010, <doi:10.1145/1835804.1835882>) implemented in 
    'mlpack', the C++ Machine Learning Library (Curtin et. al., 2013). The Dual-Tree 
    Boruvka is theoretically and empirically the fastest algorithm for computing an EMST. 
    This package also provides functions and an S3 method for readily plotting Minimum 
    Spanning Trees (MST) using either the style of the 'base', 'scatterplot3d', or 
    'ggplot2' libraries.
